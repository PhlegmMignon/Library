# Library

This project is created to practice previous learnings and demonstrate understanding of objects.


Reflection: 
I spent a lot of time trying different color palettes and layouts for this website.
As a result, my understanding of selecting colors to use in sites have been vastly improved. 
This project is also the first time I've had to add elements using JS extensively, even including svgs. 




Improvements that could've been made: 
        The form could've been more responsive at <60% browser width on a 27" monitor
        if I didn't set hard pixel values for the inputs.
